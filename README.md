## Overview

This is a Frontend Mentor challenge. I've applied challenge in NextJS environment rather than static site deployment via HTTP/JavaScript. The site features UI components, modular css designs, and pre-rendered content.

This site is available to view at [https://visionary-cendol-e005e0.netlify.app/](https://visionary-cendol-e005e0.netlify.app/)
