## Overview

This is a Frontend Mentor challenge. I've decided to attempt this challenge using React JS rather than just a static site deployment. The interface features UI components and modular css designs. More about React is found [here](https://react.dev/)

## Features
- React components utilizing Next.JS framework  
- Mobile responsive website, following design of Frontend Mentor
