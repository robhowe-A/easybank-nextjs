## Overview

This is a Frontend Mentor challenge. I've applied challenge in NextJS environment rather than static site deployment via HTTP/JavaScript. The site features UI components, modular css designs, and pre-rendered content. More about NextJS [here](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs/what-is-nextjs)
